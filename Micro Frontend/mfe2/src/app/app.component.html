<p>The Sunâ€™s powerful magnetic fields are generated by the electrically charged gases and plasma that make up our star. As this material constantly swirls around the Sun, it ends up twisting magnetic fields lines into tighter and tighter configurations, storing energy like a knotted rubber band.

  These magnetic pretzels can also leave their mark in the form of sunspots. Sunspots are areas on the Sun that appear darker than their surroundings due to strong magnetic fields preventing some of the solar heat from reaching the surface. While technically cooler than other parts of the Sun, sunspots still run extremely hot, hovering around 6,500 degrees Fahrenheit (3,600 degree Celsius).</p>
